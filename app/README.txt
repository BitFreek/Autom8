Autom8 allows you to automate anything you'd like. It is heavily used to automate music, lighting, and other effects for shows, haunted houses/hayrides, and other attractions. It can also be used to automate things around the house. There are many forms of input available (motion, ir, radio, etc.) and many available outputs (play audio track, play video, relays, etc.).
